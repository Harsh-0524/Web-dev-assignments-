1. JS ENGINE
--> They convert js code to machine codes(language)
--> Read compile and executes

2. how js engine executes your code?
--> allocating memory to variable and functions 
--> lines by lines execution

3. global execution context
--> 

4. scope and lexical env/scope

--> Scope-> where a variable is accessible 
--> 3 major scope in js
--> scope.               Accessible
   .global scope       .throughout the file/program
   .function scope     .available only inside that function
   .black scope.       .available inside that parenthesis
--> functional scope vs block scope
    var--> functional scope
    let,const-->block scope
